# Facebook Comment API By Koja

## Overview

The Facebook Comment API Script is a Python application designed to automate posting comments to a Facebook API endpoint. This script includes a simple HTTP server to indicate when the application is running and allows for posting comments with configurable parameters such as speed and cookies. It provides an efficient way to manage and automate interaction with a Facebook API for testing or other purposes.

## Features

- **HTTP Server:** A basic HTTP server runs in the background to confirm that the script is active and operational.
- **Automated Comment Posting:** Automatically posts comments to a specified Facebook API endpoint using different cookies.
- **Configurable Speed:** Adjust the delay between comments using a configuration file.
- **Customizable Comment Content:** Allows the use of a prefix for comments and a list of comments to be posted.
